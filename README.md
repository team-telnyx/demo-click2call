To get started you will need to create a credential based connection in your Telnyx portal.

You will also need to create a .env file in this projects root folder and include your Telnyx API key and a credential connection ID. A sample .env looks like this:

```
PORT=3001
TELNYX_API_KEY=KEYxxx
CONNECTION_ID=1234567890
```

Then you will run the following commands in the root project folder, and then in cd into the client folder and run the same commands

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
